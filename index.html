        <div class="explanation">
            <p>Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO<sub>2</sub>) is a chemical compound made up of molecules that each
                have
                one carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms, found in the gas state at room
                temperature.
                In the air, carbon dioxide is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a
                greenhouse gas. It is a trace gas in Earth's atmosphere at 417 ppm (about 0.04%) by volume, having risen
                from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm.Burning fossil fuels is the primary cause of these increased CO2
                concentrations and also the primary cause of global warming and climate change.Carbon dioxide is soluble
                in
                water and is found in groundwater, lakes, ice caps, and seawater. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water
                it
                forms carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), which causes ocean acidification as atmospheric
                CO<sub>2</sub>
                levels increase.</p>

            <p>Zinc Sulfate is a colorless crystalline solid. Zinc sulfate is also obtained as a hexahydrate,

                and as a heptahydrate ZnSO<sub>4</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O. All forms are soluble in water. All are
                noncombustible. The primary hazard
                is the threat posed to the environment. Immediate steps should be taken to limit its spread to the
                environment. It is used in the production of rayon, as a feed supplement, and as a fertilizer
                ingredient.Zinc sulfate is a metal sulfate compound having zinc<sup>2+</sup> as the counterion. It has a
                role as
                a
                fertilizer. It is a metal sulfate and a zinc molecular entity. It contains a zinc<sup>2+</sup>.Zinc

            <h1>Why Na + Cl&rarr;NaCl?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p>Sodium chloride is a compound formed from the ionic bonding of sodium and chloride. Sodium chloride is
                formed when sodium atoms interact with chlorine atoms. Sodium will donate an electron (which is a
                negatively-charged particle) to chlorine. This makes sodium slightly positive and chlorine slightly
                negative. Sodium becomes Na+ and Chlorine becomes Cl- Thus sodium is reduced in this process as it
                donates the electron and chlorine gain electron and is oxidized.In addition to the familiar domestic
                uses of salt, more dominant applications of the approximately 250 million tonnes per year production
                (2008 data) include chemicals and de-icing.Salt is used, directly or indirectly, in the production of
                many chemicals, which consume most of the world's production.</p>

            <h1>Why H<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub>&rarr;2HCl?</h1>

        <div class="explanation">
            <p>Hydrochloric acid, also known as muriatic acid, is an aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride. It is a
                colorless solution with a distinctive pungent smell.HCl produces a coagulation necrosis characterized by
                the formation of an eschar. Ingested HCl may give rise to damage of the esophagus and stomach.Hydrogen
                chloride may be formed by the direct combination of chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>) gas and hydrogen
                (H<sub>2</sub>) gas; the reaction is rapid at temperatures above 250 &#8451;. The reaction, represented
                by the equation H<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub>&rarr;2HCl, is accompanied by evolution of heat and
                appears to be accelerated by moisture.Hydrogen chloride can be formed during the burning of many
                plastics. Upon contact with water, it forms hydrochloric acid.As the reaction is exothermic, the
                installation is called an HCl oven or HCl burner. The resulting hydrogen chloride gas is absorbed in
                deionized water.</p>
